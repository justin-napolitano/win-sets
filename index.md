# Win-Sets

I read a paper in university about the way institutions make decisions... Or should I say the people wihtin an institution make decisions. I have applied it to analysis, but not my actual life. I'm going to try that now. 

## Background

A decision is made when all parties responsible for making a decision permit a decision to be made.  The author I think posed this as when it is in the perceived interest of the legitimate decision maker.

## My Understanding

I think percieved interest is a part of it.. but so to is the ability of the decision maker to resist pressures from internal and external parties... What I mean by this is that if a legitimate decision maker truly has the power to determine a decision... than the decision maker must be able to resist the pressure of all parties in order to enact a decision that is in the interest of the decision maker.

## Example

I experience extreme anxiety when I drive. I want to speed, I want distance from other vehicles, I want to be safe.  Other drivers want the same thing... or other drivers attempt to push their will upon the system. In effect I guess I have a set of norms and interest as do other drivers.  We all by acting enforce a set of norms upon a system.  Now beyond my immediate wants, there are legal systems in place that also reinforce a certain set of norms. 

My decision making is determine by my own ability to act in the face of pressure from the environment. My set of norms.. My set of interests are of course determined by experience and reflection.  My ability to enact those are dependent upon my ability to choose an action at a moment in time.. or better to act upon a set of behaviors that have been reinforced to such an extent that they feel intuitive.  

## Meaning 

I mean that interests converge at a point in time against a certain person.. my win-set.. the set of things that I want to happen can only come into being if the environment permits it.. and I am willing to resist the pressure that attempts to correct it. 

Sets of actions can result in an outcome... balanced of course against sets of actions from the environment around me.  

Stubborness is powerful.. but it can also be a hindrance.  The social conditions of the environment are just as important to determinging an outcome as any other factor.. if not the most important factor.

## Conclusion

I live my life wihout considering my own win-set. I do what I think is right.. but I have not really analyzed my decisions in a way that is systematic. I can do this.
