Win-Sets is a conceptual exploration of decision-making dynamics within institutions and individuals, grounded in political science theory. This repository captures a personal application of these ideas to everyday decision-making processes.

## Features

- Explanation of decision-making theory based on institutional actors and their perceived interests.
- Personal reflections on decision-making under pressure and normative influences.
- Example application to real-world anxiety and behavioral norms.

## Tech Stack

- Markdown for documentation and conceptual exposition.
- No codebase or programming language included in this repository.

## Getting Started

This repository is primarily a documentation and conceptual project. To view the content:

1. Clone the repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/justin-napolitano/win-sets.git
```

2. Open `index.md` in any Markdown viewer or editor.

## Project Structure

```
win-sets/
└── index.md         # Main conceptual document outlining the project
```

## Future Work / Roadmap

- Expand the theoretical framework with additional institutional decision-making models.
- Develop practical tools or simulations to apply win-sets theory.
- Incorporate empirical data or case studies to validate conceptual insights.
- Possibly translate conceptual notes into executable code or decision-support systems.
